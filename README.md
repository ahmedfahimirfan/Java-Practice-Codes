# ðŸ§  Java Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal Java practice codes. I focus on mastering core programming concepts like loops, branching, number theory, string manipulation, and pattern generation.

Each program is written from first principles, avoiding libraries and built-in shortcuts. My goal is to build elegant, minimal, and logically sound solutions that deepen my understanding of Java and algorithmic thinking.
